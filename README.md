## Foundations of Glitch Art

this is a collection of glitch art tools + tutorials (either new ones or updated versions of old ones) i've written for a couple reasons: it's a nice intro (from a practice perspective) to glitch for newcomers, but also i've got a handful of old tools/tutorials folks keep asking me to update, i figured i'd do that && put them all in one place [this is that place](http://nickbriz.com/databending101/)
